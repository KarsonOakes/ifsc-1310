    <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>Progressive enhancement is essentially the counter to graceful degradation. 
    Whereas graceful degradation was building a site for the newest, best technology, progressive enhancement is building a site for content, period. 
    Instead of building for the brand new smartphone, you build a website for what it needs to be and have whatever information it contains available at the most basic level. 
    Both older and newer technology can get the content, it's just that the newer technology may not get all of the pretty stuff.</p>
    <p>This is important this day going forward, because technology is constantly advancing, but some people may be left behind if they can't constantly drop money on the latest hardware and software.
    Not only could not building with progressive enhancement in mind turn people away from a site that doesn't work quite right on their device, depriving them of the content, but progressive enhancement also gives a strong foundation for a website.
    Progressive enhancement says to build the program starting with content in HTML with all content available on a basic level, then work through CSS and Javascript to make it look right.
    When you have a strong foundation, you can modify it easily and to your heart's content.
    It's better to build a house on a rock than on the sand.</p>
    <p>For further reading, I found an article that helped me further understand where progressive enhancement fits in the modern day:<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-progressive-enhancement-and-why-it-matters-e80c7aaf834a/"> What is Progressive Enhancement and why it matters</a></p>

    <h2>Segway Centaur Project Revision</h2>
    <p>For the revision, I had both my mother and my older brother look at it while we were all talking. My mother's main issue on the Home page was that the articles were really long. She was also disappointed when she found out there were more pictures that could have been used but weren't.
    My brother said that the articles took up way too much space, and they looked like something that would be better to click through instead of scrolling through.</p>
    <p>They had less to say about my FAQ and About pages. The main complaint on the FAQ was that it looked a little bland. They agreed that pictures wouldn't really help, but more color could. In my About page, they just talked about how the text seemed a little too close.</p>
    <p>To address the problems on my Home page, I first added a gallery and used what we learned in the cycle lab to get a couple more images showing off the centaur at the top without taking up too much space. I went online to find out how I could click through the articles and added the necessary Javascript.
    Concerning the amount of text and initial size of the articles, I put the text into details sections that allow the user to focus on the specification in which they're interested.</p>
    <p>For the FAQ, I changed the text colors to match the color scheme. I toyed with the thought of doing an accordian list, but I dropped that idea due to it being jittery. In the About page, I simply increased line size.</p>
    <p>I learned a lot doing this project. Not only was it where I got to toy with a lot of CSS, but I also got to play with Javascript. I love being able to use what I've learned to obtain a good result in a fun project.
    I learned a lot about how to target different things in CSS, all sorts of ways to modify my code visually, and I've gotten a decent understanding of audiences. In terms of Javascript, I have a ton to learn, but what little I did looked effective.</p>
    <p>One thing I would probably do differently is condense it from the very beginning. I would have also started out using the code provided instead of pulling my hair out trying to build the code up. It wasn't too hard, but I had to think in many spots.</p>
    <p>This class was really fun, and I learned a ton about web design. I enjoyed coding and finding new ways to do everything. I probably should have listened more closely in class and taken notes/done things alongside you, because I've had to go back into the recordings to refresh my knowledge on multiple things.</p>
