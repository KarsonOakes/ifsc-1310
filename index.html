    <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>Progressive enhancement is essentially the counter to graceful degradation. 
    Whereas graceful degradation was building a site for the newest, best technology, progressive enhancement is building a site for content, period. 
    Instead of building for the brand new smartphone, you build a website for what it needs to be and have whatever information it contains available at the most basic level. 
    Both older and newer technology can get the content, it's just that the newer technology may not get all of the pretty stuff.</p>
    <p>This is important this day going forward, because technology is constantly advancing, but some people may be left behind if they can't constantly drop money on the latest hardware and software.
    Not only could not building with progressive enhancement in mind turn people away from a site that doesn't work quite right on their device, depriving them of the content, but progressive enhancement also gives a strong foundation for a website.
    Progressive enhancement says to build the program starting with content in HTML with all content available on a basic level, then work through CSS and Javascript to make it look right.
    When you have a strong foundation, you can modify it easily and to your heart's content.
    It's better to build a house on a rock than on the sand.</p>
    <p>For further reading, I found an article that helped me further understand where progressive enhancement fits in the modern day:<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-progressive-enhancement-and-why-it-matters-e80c7aaf834a/"> What is Progressive Enhancement and why it matters</a></p>
