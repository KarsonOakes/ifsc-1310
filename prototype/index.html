            <h2>He Was in Space</h2>
            <p>
                Yes, you heard me correctly, Gordo was <em>in space</em> I know some may think that's a big deal, but to me it's a <strong>HUGE DEAL</strong>! It takes more than just a normal monkey to go into space.
                Gordo was twice the monkey you will <strong>EVER</strong> be. Don't even think about slandering his name by saying <q>But we've sent humans into space, and they came back.</q>
            </p>
            <h3>Do You Know What's in Space?</h3>
            <p>
                That's right, I bet you don't. It's not what's in space that should scare you, but there are scary things, it's what <em>ISN'T</em> in space that should. Let's go over it:
                
            </p>
            <h4>Air</h4>
            <p>
                You like air? Well too bad! Space has no air. Gordo was trained to not only accept that there was no air, but to be without air for hours on end!
            </p>
                <blockquote>
                    But Gordo wore a special suit with air, and the shuttle had air.
                    <cite>Wrong People Anonymous</cite>
                </blockquote>
            <p>
                <strong>WRONG!</strong> Sure, modern technology may be able to do that now, but in Gordo's time, both men and monkies were stronger. They had to train to hold their breath for the entire trip.
                How long can you hold your breath? 30 seconds to a minute? Ha, Gordo would be so disappointed right now. Not only are you worse at holding your breath, you're also:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Physically weaker</li>
                <li>Mentally weaker</li>
                <li>At most, half as good at math</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Monsters, Probably</h4>
            <p>
                You heard me right, there are probably monsters in space, and Gordo had to be ready. He was taught Kung fu as well as the use of a blaster pistol. The terrifying beasts beyond our atmosphere were accustomed to zero gravity,
                so Gordo was already at a disadvantage. Legends say that he took out at least 2 Zyndwurms and 3 Knarlofects. I doubt you've even heard of them.
            </p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Zyndwurms</dt>
                <dd>Terrifying creatures with multiple heads, each head able to launch a different type of star</dd>
                <dt>Knarlofects</dt>
                <dd>Human-sized entities with four sharp blades that can tear through hull like it was paper</dd>
            </dl>
            <h5>Still Better Than You</h5>
            <p>
                This is just a reminder that Gordo is better than you.
            </p>
            <h2>He Was On a Mission</h2>
            <h3>The Mission</h3>
            <p>
                Gordo's mission was fairly simple:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Take a deep breath</li>
                <li>Blastoff!</li>
                <li>Meet the king of Earth's atmosphere for permission to cross</li>
                <li>Defend the ship from whatever horrors attacked</li>
                <li>Reenter Earth's atmosphere</li>
                <li>Land and earn at least 5 medals</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                It was all going well, but one of the Zyndwurms' stars hit his parachute, causing a malfunction. Gordo did what he could to slow the ship, narrowly avoiding a flock of space geese, but the damage was too much.
                Gordo sadly passed away, his final breath being air from his home planet. He wasn't afraid. He set in motion amazing events that would change history forever.
            </p>
            <h2>He Made the Ultimate Sacrifice</h2>
            <h3>The Funeral</h3>
            <p>
                Everyone around the world knew of Gordo's death, and his funeral was broadcast all over the world. For a few brief moments, there was complete unity. A hero had fallen. Tears were shed by all but the most heartless
                people.
            </p>
            <h2>He Looked Cool</h2>
            <h3>Image</h3>
            <p>Gordo's picture only goes to prove that he was twice the monkey anyone will ever be. It can be broken down into a few simple elements, but those elements don't serve him justice.</p>
